## What is expected of us in Phase 4- Testing
```
* Test both Threads A and B.
* Check their code against the use case pre and post conditions specified in the Master Spec
* If a function does not work at all that you cannot test it, write that in your report and do not change their code to test * it. If you have to change a variable to test, please specify it in your report. 
* Eg. If a function throws and error instead of an exception it doesnt work.
* There are no git repository marks for this phase(apparently), Happy Testing:)
