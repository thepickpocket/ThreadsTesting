\begin{flushleft}

\subsubsection{SubmitPost}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{Test Status:} \emph{Partial Pass}. \\

\textbf{Details:}
The submit post use-case was divided into seperate smaller functions. One function \emph{create(mUser, mParent, mPostType, mHeading, mContent, mMimeType)} is used to initialize the process of creating a new thread as well as its embedded post object. This function calls \emph{createNewThread(mUser, mParent, mLevel, mPostType, mHeading, mContent, mMimeType, mSubject)} which parses the current thread and post object to JSON strings and then persists them in a remote database.\\
The problem however is that when child threads are created using the \emph{createThread(...)} function call, the child thread is never persisted to the remote datase.
